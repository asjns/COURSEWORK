ANTHONY JONES, CONTEST 1

I worked with my team on Oct 2 to do the Bob Jones programming competition. I can't find the solutions to the problems, but I worked on 'Prerequisites', 'Scrambled Polygons', 'Parry This', 'Untitled Problem', and 'Horse Queen Moves'. I think I actually only solved the prerequisites and untitled problems, but the majority of them were a group effort. Overall, the competition was one of the best ones that I've participated in, since I actually contributed a lot to the implementation of solutions (in previous competitions, I worked mostly on a pseudo-code solution, or theoretically description of the problem, while others did the coding). I really enjoyed working with my teammates, and I felt like we got a lot accomplished even though it was our first practice together. Problems are given (without our solutions... couldnt find them on the website) in the website: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/bju-fall-contest-2021/challenges.
