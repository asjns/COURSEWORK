My choices for the three contests were all on the codechef.com website, which is a popular website for coding competitions. 
They have several monthly contests, and each of the contests are broken into different Divisions. For the most part, I found
that Divisions 3 and 4 were too easy, whereas Division 2 was too difficult for me to complete. This is similar to how on
the USACO competitions, Bronze and Silver problems are typically easy but the Gold difficulty problems are where things
begin to get much harder. I chose to do all my competitions on codechef because (a) they have more problems involving math,
which I am majoring in; and (b) they allow you to test your code after competitions are completed (which I could not find
on many other websites). I spent roughly 3 hours per competition, solving 3-4 problems each time. I spent most of my time
looking through the Division 2 problems, which were harder; however there were some Division 3 problems that I coded up
easily when I needed a break. For a single person, I think I performed well; however there are areas which I clearly can
improve on.

For my two areas of improvement, I decide that I need to work on building basic graphs (in python) and solving problems traversing the graphs. For example, there is one problem in the last contest that I knew I could not do as I was not familiar enough with python to solve it, and C++ was too difficult for me to code up and finish.
