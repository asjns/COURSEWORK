This is my solution for a dijkstra algorithm in python. There are two basic data structures which are useful for representing graphs and the solutions to graph problems: they are the dict() and deque() structures. In this example, I represent the nodes as all the numbers 

1....n

and I represent their edges with a set of neighbors given. This basically creatures a collection of adj lists, for example:

	0: [1,2]
	1: [0]
	2: [0]
	3: None

Would represent the following graph:

	(0)------(1)
	 |
	(2)      (3)

My solution uses dijkstras algorithm to visit each node adjacent to the starting node, 
and then to find whether there is a path from point A to point B.
