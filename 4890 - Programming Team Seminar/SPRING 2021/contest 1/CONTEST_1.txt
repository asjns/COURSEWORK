For the first contest, I worked with my friend and teammate Ben Braun to complete the COCI's 5th contest.

We worked together at his apartment, as I did not own a laptop and I could not work on my computer at the time. Therefore,
our general strategy was to read the problems, try to find a paper solution, and then try to implement the solution with
his laptop and PC. He is much more familiar with python, so he worked quickly to implement those solutions; while I worked 
instead on implementing C++ solutions for other problems.

Our mindset coming into this contest was to get a fresh dive into the atmosphere of a contest. We didn't plan much and we
were not very prepared to do well for it. That being said, we did complete the first task and we got partial credit on the
second one. I believe I found a solution to the third task, Magenta, but I could not implement the solution in time. This
contest only lasted for 3 hours, so we were not prepared enough to jump right into coding.

Overall I believe the contest was a successful practice because we did find solutions to three problems, and we did improve
our coding familiarity with the problems.
