ANTHONY JONES, CONTEST 2

For this contest, I completed an arrangement of problems on Kattis, which were compiled to be of beginner-moderate level difficulty. I can't find the actual contest that I attempted, but the problems and their solutions are provided in the folder. It was a relatively easy contest, so when I finished I continued working on a few dynamic programming problems (which are also in the file). These were much more difficult; and, in my experience, it is usually the dynammic programming problems or problems with dynammic programming solutions that I have the most difficulty with. The contest was a week-long contest, but I only worked on the problems for the final 4 hours. I would say that this problem was an excellent warm up to python, and I think several of the problems I finished were basically the "give-me" problems that you often find in contests.
